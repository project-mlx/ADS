Just like python lists, Linked List is an array like data structure. However, Linked lists are quite different than arrays, 
as their elements are not stored at sequenced locations. Linked Lists are a product of connected nodes and a node is a composite 
of two properties, the element that we want to store and the next node which contain our next element and key to the next node, and so on.

Advantages:
- Dynamic Data Structure
- Flexible memory allocation (Linked Lists are not fixed in size)
- Ease of insertion and deletion
